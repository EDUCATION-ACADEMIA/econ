<strong> A government wishes to impose a tax on a good so that the producer and not the consumer pays most of the tax. Which type of elasticity would it be best for the good to have to achieve this aim? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** high price elasticity of demand 
</p>
<p>(B) low price elasticity of demand 
</p>
<p>(C) totally inelastic price elasticity of demand 
</p>
<p>(D) unitary price elasticity of demand 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-When a tax is imposed on a good for which the supply is relatively elastic and the demand is relatively inelastic, Buyers of the good will bear most of the burden of the tax. More, and sellers receive less than they did before the tax.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-If demand is perfectly inelastic, consumers always buy the same amount and therefore pay the entire burden of the tax. Sellers therefore get the same price they received before.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The more elastic the supply curve, the easier it is for sellers to reduce the quantity sold instead of taking lower prices. In a market where both the demand and supply are very elastic, the imposition of an excise tax generates low revenue.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-If a tax is imposed on a market with inelastic demand and elastic supply: buyers will bear most of the burden of the tax.
