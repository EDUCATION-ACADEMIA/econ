<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The government makes one requirement of them in exchange for this ability: keep a certain amount of deposits on hand to cover possible withdrawals. This amount is called the reserve requirement, and it is the rate that banks must keep in reserve and are not allowed to lend.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Fed has traditionally used three tools to conduct monetary policy: reserve requirements, the discount rate, and open market operations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The required reserve ratio gives the percent of deposits that banks must hold as reserves. It is the ratio of required reserves to deposits. If the required reserve ratio is 10 percent this means that banks must hold 10 percent of their deposits as required reserves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-To increase the (growth of the) money supply, the Fed could either buy bonds, lower the reserve requirement ratio, or lower the discount rate. To decrease the (growth of the) money supply, the Fed could either sell bonds, raise the reserve requirement ratio, or raise the discount rate. 24.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A reduction in the required reserve ratio from 20% to 10% is an expansionary monetary policy because it implies that the banks are required to keep a lower proportion of the total deposits in the form of reserves, freeing up money to be given out as loans for credit creation.
