<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Goal-setting skills will help you take control over your life and give it purpose and direction. Unlike most skills, decision-making does not get easier with practice.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-To be realistic, a goal must represent an objective toward which you are both willing and able to work. A goal can be both high and realistic; you are the only one who can decide just how high your goal should be. Your goal is probably realistic if you truly believe that it can be accomplished.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An example of a blaming you-message is saying “You made me so angry.” Also, beware of starting sentences with “You always” or “You never.” These sentence starters can cause the listener to become defensive and halt communication rather than help to clearly address an issue and successfully solve a problem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-What is the difference between motivation and self-management? Motivation propels you to do something. Self-management involves knowing what you want to achieve and keeping yourself on track so that you do eventually achieve your goal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-S = specific. Your goal should include details of what you want to accomplish. M = measurable. You should be able to measure your progress and accurately determine whether you’ve accomplished your goal. A = attainable. Your goals should challenge you. R = realistic. T = timely.
