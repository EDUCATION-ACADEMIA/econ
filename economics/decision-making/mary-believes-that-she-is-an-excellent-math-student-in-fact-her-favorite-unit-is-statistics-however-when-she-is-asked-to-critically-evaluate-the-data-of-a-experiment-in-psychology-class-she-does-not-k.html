<strong> Mary believes that she is an excellent math student. In fact, her favorite unit is statistics. However, when she is asked to critically evaluate the data of a experiment in psychology class, she does not know how to do it. How does the Dual Process model explain this? 
</strong>
<p>(A) She has developed the System 2 thinking necessary for math class, but not for psychology class. 
</p>
<p>(B) Her knowledge from mathematics is interfering with her knowledge in psychology. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** She is not able to transfer her understanding in mathematics to a new context (situation). So, her approach to solving the problem shows System 1 thinking. 
</p>
<p>(D) Mary’s self-esteem in psychology class is interfering with her ability to solve the problem. It has nothing to do with System 1 and System 2 thinking.
