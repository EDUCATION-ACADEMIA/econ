In perfect competition, no one has the ability to affect prices.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In economic theory, perfect competition occurs when all companies sell identical products, market share does not influence price, companies are able to enter or exit without barriers, buyers have perfect or full information, and companies cannot determine prices.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Oligopoly means few sellers. In an oligopolistic market, each seller supplies a large portion of all the products sold in the marketplace. In addition, because the cost of starting a business in an oligopolistic industry is usually high, the number of firms entering it is low.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In a perfect competition market structure, there are a large number of buyers and sellers. All the sellers of the market are small sellers in competition with each other. There is no one big seller with any significant influence on the market. So all the firms in such a market are price takers.
