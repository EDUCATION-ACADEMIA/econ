</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-They are a form of price control. While in the short run, they often benefit consumers, the long-term effects of price ceilings are complex. They can negatively impact producers and sometimes even the consumers they aim to help, by causing supply shortages and a decline in the quality of goods and services.
