<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-When a price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price, quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied, and excess demand or shortages will result. Price floors prevent a price from falling below a certain level.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-How do unregulated markets cure a “labor shortage” when there are no immigrants to boost the labor supply? Solution: • Unregulated markets cure a labor shortage by pushing up the wage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If the price is too high to clear the market, we mean that the quantity supplied is higher than the quantity demanded. This is so because at higher prices, suppliers supply more. So, there is excess quantity supplied. On the other hand, at higher prices, consumers demand less in the market.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-If a government decides to make health insurances affordable by requiring all health insurance companies to cut their prices by 30%, what will probably happen to the number of people covered by health insurance? This will create shortage in health insurance, and fewer people will be covered.
