<strong> Brett plans to save money toward purchasing a car. His co-worker is telling him about a Money Market Account he has that offers a tiered interest rate. What is Brett’s co-worker talking about? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** The amount of money he earns depends on the balance, i.e. the higher the account balance the higher the interest rate he would earn. 
</p>
<p>(B) The amount of money he earns depends on the number of accounts he has at the depository institution, i.e. the more accounts he has, the higher interest rate he will earn. 
</p>
<p>(C) Brett’s co-worker is talking about something that is illegal. A tieredaccount is promoted by scam artists who trick people into investing money in hopes of earning higher rates over time. 
</p>
<p>(D) The rate of interest earned increases over time, i.e. leaving money in the account for 3 months would earn a lower interest rate than leaving money in the account for 12 months.
