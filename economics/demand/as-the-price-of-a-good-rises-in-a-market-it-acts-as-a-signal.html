<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The relationship between price and quantity supplied is a direct relationship. Economists refer to this relationship as the law of supply. When the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied of that good will increase.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-High prices are signals to producers to produce more and buyers to buy less. Low prices are signals for producers to produce less and for buyers to buy more.
